# Pin constraints for iCEBreaker FPGA board
# DVS Gesture Accelerator with UART interface
#
# CRITICAL: Uses internal power-on reset - no external reset pin needed
# This matches the proven working design pattern

# Clock (12MHz oscillator)
set_io clk 35

# UART (onboard FTDI USB-UART)
# FPGA RX = Pin 6 (receives from PC/FTDI TX)
# FPGA TX = Pin 9 (transmits to PC/FTDI RX)
set_io uart_rx 6
set_io uart_tx 9

# Heartbeat LED to show FPGA is alive (accent LED, active low)
set_io led_heartbeat 39
